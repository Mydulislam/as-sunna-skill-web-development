    <h1>Call Back Function</h1>
    <p>A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the completion of that function. Callback functions are commonly used in JavaScript, especially in asynchronous operations, to specify what should happen once a particular operation is finished. They allow you to control the flow of your code and handle operations that may take some time to complete.</p>

    <h2>Here are a few key points about callback functions:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Callback functions are functions passed as arguments to other functions.</li>
        <li>They are often used in asynchronous programming to handle the completion of asynchronous tasks, such as reading a file, making an API request, or setting a timer. </li>
        <li>Callbacks allow you to define what should happen once the asynchronous task is done, making your code more flexible and responsive.</li>
        <li>Callbacks can take parameters and can be customized to perform different actions based on the result or context of the asynchronous operation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Callback functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript and are widely used in scenarios involving event handling, AJAX requests, timers, and more. They play a crucial role in managing asynchronous code and ensuring that it executes in a non-blocking manner.</p>
