    <h1>Javascript Promise</h1>
    <p>Promises are a powerful tool in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations. Promises provide a more structured way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.</p>
    <h4>A Promise can be in one of three states:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pending:</b> The initial state when the asynchronous operation has not yet completed.</li>
        <li><b>Fulfilled (Resolved):</b> The state representing a successful completion of the operation, resulting in a value.</li>
        <li><b>Rejected:</b> The state representing a failure in the operation, accompanied by an error reason.</li>
    </ul>
